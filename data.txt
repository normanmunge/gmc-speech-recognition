Because we claim to be brothers? Why can't we create a Support system?

Otherswise, no need for a group. I won't be afraid to say I'm a deeply flawed person.

But with our individual qualities, why not merge and rule?

I will humbly accept all comments.

But with our individual

From the other social group ya MHS and AGHS alumnis, we had a social event the weekend before last. One of the old boys, class of 91, a very accomplished farmer in Emali asked that we invite one or two of them in one of our class' meet ups for some wise counsel. 

Your thoughts...

[01/06/2024, 18:18:10] Robe Mangu: Hata Dortmund wakianza kuwalima, utaona miujiza na Madrid watatamba mwishowe. 😅

Hii game ni formality tu! 🤩
[01/06/2024, 18:18:39] Høsea: I think the reason why Real Madrid is so dominant on the European top tier is MENTALITY.
Madrid players always believe they should win.

Opponents have been conditioned to approach the game from an inferior position.

I hope this message finds you well. 

As you all know, one of us has recently suffered a tragic twist of fate. The loss of a parent is a harrowing experience. Hence the need for us as a community to offer Patrick and his family the support they need during this difficult time.

The burial is scheduled for Thursday next week (13/06). As we know, funerals are costly, and financial support can make a world of difference to the grieving family. 

Therefore, if possible, please consider contributing whatever amount you can to help facilitate the ongoing burial preparations. Please send your contributions to my M-pesa number, 0707967617 (Mark Mitti).

Thank you in advance for standing in solidarity with our bereaved brother.

Warm regards.

We have a requeim mass scheduled for Tuesday at Holy Family Basillica.

We also have daily meetings at our home in Githurai 45, Tembo Farm.

Most of these youths have degrees but remain jobless. unemployment coupled up with high cost of living is the main reason youths are demonstrating. The Finance Bill is just a trigger but the main cause of these demonstrations is unemployment and high cost of living.

[25/06/2024, 21:35:42] Valentino Shimanyi: True!
[25/06/2024, 21:35:57] Valentino Shimanyi: The truth is! If we don’t speak, we will never have a voice.
[25/06/2024, 21:37:01] Valentino Shimanyi: First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

[25/06/2024, 21:59:50] D.n.G: This man is a serious narcissist, sociopath and a sick pathological liar. Hajawai simama akaongea ukweli.
[25/06/2024, 21:59:51] D.n.G: The only way it makes sense is that ni wizi tu inafanyika.
[25/06/2024, 22:00:36] Norman Munge: But that speech of his was quite ironical given all the things he’s done so far. Saying it goes against the constitution yet he went against the judiciary, all the abductions, the corruption scandals we’ve had so far. The biggest criminals are in parliament. The pot can’t call the kettle black.

[25/06/2024, 22:11:56] D.n.G: History though has that a failing state begins with draconian rules. His way of rule is not sustainable. Things are boiling.
[25/06/2024, 22:13:35] Andrew: Interesting part 3 c says "with the approval of National Assembly" but the CS gazetted the deployment without that, isn't that also illegal? 🤔🤔

So hawa maboyz walikua washawashow finance bill ndio the way.

[26/06/2024, 16:30:32] Henry Mangu: Not really... if he remains silent and Does Not sign the Bill, it automatically becomes Law after 14 Days... If he refers the Bill Back to Parliament with Amendments or Comments, Parliament has to debate on it and return it back to the President with or without incorporating the said Amendments.. consequently, he has to sign and if he doesn't, it automatically becomes law after 14 days
[26/06/2024, 16:32:43] ~ Marcus: MPs are going on recession as from today. Unless speaker alters their schedule.

[26/06/2024, 17:55:22] ~ Marcus: Learned friends in the house, article 115 does not talk about the president withdrawing a bill. The only time a bill can be withdrawn is during the reading stages. What do you say ?
[26/06/2024, 18:06:51] ~ Dennis Kamau: On the question of withdrawals of Bills, the following are my considered views:

1. Article 115 of the Constitution speaks to two specific processes: assent and withdrawal.
2. Note that clause (2) is subjected to ''apporpriate procedures" which should be read to mean Standing Orders.
3. Once a Bill is returned back to Parliament for reconsideration, it becomes a Bill pending reconsideration before the National Assembly.
4. Therefore, the Bill is available for withdrawal by the sponsor, in this case the Chair of Budget Committee in consultation with the National Treasury ( under Standing Order 140). 
5. Based on a purposive interpretation of the Constitution, clause (3) and (4) kick in when the Bill is not withdrawn and is available for consideration of the reservation by the President. 
6. Clause (6) is meant to deal with the inaction on the part of the President- not assenting or referring back. 
7. Accordingly, withdrawal, referral or assent are terms of art to be accorded purposive meaning in the context of the entire scheme of law making.
8.
I so submit.
[26/06/2024, 18:11:42] ~ Marcus: I differ, withdrawals are not done once the Bill has been sent to the president. In fact, article 115 does not talk about withdrawals. Article 115 seeks to cure any conflict between the president and parliament. Article 115 has no provisions for withdrawals at all
[26/06/2024, 18:15:22] ~ Dennis Kamau: agreeably, there is no explicit stance on withdrawal once sent to the president but this interpretation could make sense based on the consensus. overall we wait and see.
[26/06/2024, 18:17:03] ~ Marcus: Allow me to use unethical language. Imagine a bill under article 115 as a child born with sickness. You can't abort or refuse this child. The only option is to accept it as it is (the president signs it into law) or you take to a doctor to handle the condition (back to parliament for amendments). But you cannot kill/abort/withdraw the child since they are already born. ‎<This message was edited>
[26/06/2024, 18:30:31] ~ Marcus: Basically there is no provision in the constitution that talks about withdrawing an Act of Parliament. The president has no capacity to withdraw an Act of Parliament. The only option, is for the parliament to Repeal the act

[09/08/2024, 09:58:46] ~ Miriti: Flashback Friday
One day during inter-dorms sports Theophilus agreed to represent our dormitory, Cardinal Otunga in the 800 metres. Since he had a big chest and could run far much than most of us we knew he would win. We had so much hope in our champion. Once the race started he didn't disappoint us. He was leading the pack. He looked determined and focused. We knew he was setting the pace so that he could finish strong. Just past 500 metres mark he started slowing down. We the cheering squad started chanting "Theo,Table" but it didn't motivate him. Mind you members of Table Three had promised him three extra meat 🍖 pieces. We had glucose half a kilo waiting for him at the finishing line.We cheered him to the last and he came last. Later after the race I asked him why he stopped running and he told me he didn't stop running. His spirit, mind and heart were running 🏃‍♂️ to win but his legs failed him on that day. From that day I stopped blaming any athlete that win but keeps running to the end.
God bless Mang'u
God bless Kenya

As we were getting ready for our final exams in high school we all had mixed feelings. Some people felt inadequately prepared while others like Comfort were oozing with confidence. So the unprepared and the guys that were prepared but didn't want to take chances with the final exam hatched a plan to get leakage. They contacted a dealer who was a student at JKUAT. They crowdfunded for the money to pay that guy.They were to pay in bits with the first paper being a benchmark of how legit the leakages were. The JKUAT comrade didn't have access to the exam but he couldn't let such an amount slide. After day 1 of the exams everyone knew they had been treated as Uasin Gishu students who dreamt of studying and working in Finland. Whoever was the Jimi Wanjigi of the whole project called the JKUAT dealer and assured him that his products were legit and everybody is so happy to have found him.So the guy asked for more money so that we can have uninterrupted supply of leakage. Jimi Wanjigi informed our guy that since that money was for washwash he needed to come collect it in person. 
The how,the when and the why he was to get to Mang'u was well planned and finally executed. The supply came in the spirit of our motto Jishinde Ushinde. At first he was greeted with cheerful smiles. He was assured that he was indeed one of our own. All along in his mind he was counting his money.He was delayed waiting for most teachers to leave and for darkness to hide our faces. 
No one knows exactly how that mob justice thing started but in few minutes he was left with an FC Barcelona short and a vest. He screamed louder than Mike Sonko the day Police manhandled his member. 
What baffled me during the whole debacle is that CU and SDA guys were the most vocal and violent. Even Jesus didn't whip those conducting business in the temple the way you guys did it. Anyway I stand with that guy and demand justice for him. He has requested you guys to channel your contributions to 0725107225 for compensation as he isn't pursuing legal means. TIA as you purpose to compensate him. 😂

[28/08/2024, 11:31:13] Jackso: Good man!
[28/08/2024, 11:31:27] Jackso: Ooh I was talking about mine.
[28/08/2024, 11:36:14] Andrew: Why is it at 30mbps? Thought starlink was faster?
[28/08/2024, 11:48:06] Valentino Shimanyi: Uploads are not.
[28/08/2024, 11:50:41] ~ Marcus: Please, be as simple as possible. Me, Masaba, na Abedi hatutaki story mob. Just tell us, we buy starlink or remain with safcom.
[28/08/2024, 11:50:46] Andrew: That plus ping being low is making me second guess this option!!!
[28/08/2024, 11:54:55] ~ Marcus: Ping ni nini sasa ?
[28/08/2024, 11:55:32] ~ Miriti: Sisi tunajua tu ping pong
[28/08/2024, 11:55:42] ~ Marcus: Exactly
[28/08/2024, 11:57:02] Valentino Shimanyi: Latency for Starlink is a little high. Buy or not buy? It depends 😊. 

IMO, when I used it, it was quite good actually.
[28/08/2024, 11:57:19] Andrew: Measure of latency.
[28/08/2024, 11:58:17] ~ Marcus: Latency tena ? Do i need a dictionary to use starlink ?
[28/08/2024, 12:00:43] ~ Al Fred: ‎Waiting for this message. This may take a while.
[28/08/2024, 12:01:25] ~ Miriti: One jargon a day wangwana
[28/08/2024, 12:05:17] ~ Marcus: Safaricom killed Posta, now its about to face same fate...
[28/08/2024, 12:07:13] Andrew: Quick correction - Saf and zuku ping is low 55ms (milliseconds) personal experience. Starlink ping noted via users on tiktok in Kenya - 150 to 220ms. @254726362618 The higher the ping, the worse the browsing or online gaming experience. Streaming may not notice it too much due to server processing.
[28/08/2024, 12:07:13] Andrew: Latency refers to lag. Picture you're in Mombasa and I'm in Nairobi, I send you a file via Safaricom and it takes 55 milliseconds to transfer as opposed to starlink that takes 220 milliseconds to transfer. Please note that milliseconds are a very minute level of time measurement so you may not notice it, but for those that are gaming online and require high level graphics processed, it may mean the difference between winning and losing your game (especially if it's competitive and money is involved).
[28/08/2024, 12:09:29] Andrew: Did you get to those touted speeds za 200mbps?
[28/08/2024, 12:15:32] ~ JB: Donwload speeds being high are more important than a low latency for most users
[28/08/2024, 12:15:47] ~ JB: Gamers are the most affected by latency.
[28/08/2024, 12:15:55] ~ JB: So for most people that is still acceptable
[28/08/2024, 12:17:41] Jackso: Yeah issue ya starlink ni latency. Kama wewe ni online gamer, it will cause lag etc.
[28/08/2024, 12:18:03] ~ JB: Now Safaricom have disbaled Mpesa option for purchasing Starlink 😅
More reason to buy it
[28/08/2024, 12:20:13] Valentino Shimanyi: I got 80-110mbps.
[28/08/2024, 12:20:54] Valentino Shimanyi: Haha these guys. lol.
[28/08/2024, 12:21:50] ~ JB: Bt for 6500 both options are more than what normal home internet users would need. 
Saf home faiba 40Mbs @6300 low latency VS
Starlink 100Mbps @6500 higher latency

I think ill stick to saf for a while unless niangukie 45k ya kubuy statlink. 
Cost of acquiring ndo noma tu
[28/08/2024, 12:23:25] ~ JB: Past 40Mbs for normal users ata download speeds dont matter now that we stream movies rather than downloading them. 
40Mbs will seamlessly stream any 4k movie
[28/08/2024, 12:24:04] ~ JB: So unless mtu ako na very specific or maybe keeping up with trends needs no need for starlink.

[06/09/2024, 22:40:17] ~ Miriti: Good evening guys our #FlashbackFriday took a break to mourn with families that have lost their kids in the Endarasha Hillside Academy fire tragedy. Joining school and coming out alive isn't a joke. As a result our next episode will be about a tragedy.
[07/09/2024, 01:16:58] Nzioka Mangu: Will it though?

[07/09/2024, 01:51:35] ~ Bwatuti: Saf haijaevolve?..sorry natry kuelewa hiyo point yako ya government backed companies zenye hazijaevolve.
[07/09/2024, 02:02:51] Nzioka Mangu: Saf imegeuka a crooked thing.
The theft it allows juu haikua regulated. The disregard for customers. Caring only about profits. Since Bob Collymore left they have regressed. The current management killed Safaricom Jazz Festival which was great for CSR. During the protests they helped the police force thus siding with the oppressor. Let's not touch on M-Pesa and the failure to adhere to regulations. It has crippled the chances of Mpesa expanding regionally.

By the look of things the legislators will not prosecute these infractions, if anything, they will let the rot continue. 

Survival ya Saf inategemea heavy handed suppression of any competitors.

Just so you know, Africans are the fathers of civilisation.

Also, Africans are masters of deception and propaganda. The White man thinks he's been on top of the game yet he's just been a pawn in a game of chess for millenia.
